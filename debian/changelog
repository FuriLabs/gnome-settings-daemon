gnome-settings-daemon (2.28.1-1ubuntu1) lucid; urgency=low

  * Sync on Debian
  * debian/control.in:
    - build-depends on libpulse and libcanberra
    - recommends on pulseaudio
    - set vcs location
  * debian/gnome-settings-daemon.gconf-defaults:
    - enable tap_on_click and disable_while_typing on by default,
      it's the less confusing behaviour for user and was the consensus
      during the discussion on the lists
    - ensure that touchpad settings are migrated to the new
      config where appropriate (LP#404219).
    - use subpixel rendering and slight hinting as the default in jaunty 
      (even on CRT monitors for now) (LP#332172)
  * debian/gnome-settings-daemon.install:
    - don't move the autostart to a non standard directory as debian
    - install dbus service

  * debian/patches/02_fix_randr.patch:

  * debian/patches/03_gdm_keyboard_variant_handling.patch:
    - gdm's configuration and $GDM_KEYBOARD_LAYOUT separates layout and variant 
      with a space, but GConf uses tabs. Convert spaces to tabs in 
      $GDM_KEYBOARD_LAYOUT to work with either format, for more robustness.
  * debian/patches/11_sleepkey.patch:
    - there is no key assigned to sleep by default and gdm-signal does not 
      exist on the default install
  * debian/patches/16_use_synchronous_notifications.patch:
    - use synchronous notifications when they are supported
  * debian/patches/20_gstreamer.patch:
    - don't use this debian change but rather the upstream code version
  * debian/patches/40_xres_lcddefault.patch: 
    - OpenOffice.org subpixel font rendering broken with new cairo (LP#271283)
  * debian/patches/70_migrate_touchpad_config.patch:
    - ensure that touchpad settings are migrated to the new
      config where appropriate
  * debian/patches/71_fix_ldsm_notification_crash.patch:
    - Don't access free'd memory if a volume is unmounted whilst the
      dialog is displayed
  * debian/patches/90_autoreconf.patch:
    - use autoreconf naming rather than relibtoolize it makes cleared what to do
  * debian/patches/91_gsd_locate_pointer_path_fix.patch:
    - Upstream GIT change to honour libexecdir when spawning gsd-locate-pointer
  * debian/rules:
    - don't disable the pulseaudio use 
  * debian/watch:
    - watch unstable serie
