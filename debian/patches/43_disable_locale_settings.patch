Description: Don't set locales since they are set in Oneiric by sourcing ~/.profile.
Forwarded: not-needed
Author: Gunnar Hjalmarsson <ubuntu@gunnar.cc>

*
* The set_locale() function is questionable anyhow, since it's called after ~/.profile is
* sourced (by gdm) which prevents users from fine tuning the locale settings that way.
